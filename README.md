# Phillips Hue Alarm
After having reliability issues with setting an alarm in the offical [Phillips Hue app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue/id557206189?mt=8) I decided to
create a Python script that will automatically turn on my Phillips Hue bulb at a certain hour by utilizing a [Linux cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). For this particular setup
I am utilizing a [Rasberry Pi](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Project-Board/dp/B00T2U7R7I/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1453429240&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi) as my Linux server.
